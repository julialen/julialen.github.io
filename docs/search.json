    "text": "I am particularly excited to understand how cryptography gets used in practice and to apply principled approaches for improving the security and privacy of deployed protocols and applications. These approaches range from identifying flaws in existing protocols to developing new theory and definitions and then designing new cryptographic schemes.\nMy recent interests include: \n\nInteroperable end-to-end encrypted messaging, which allows users to communicate across providers. This is mandated in the E.U. by the Digital Markets Act, and WhatsApp and Messenger have proposed interoperable protocols for their applications. I’m investigating the security and privacy of this setting and proposing new designs.\nAbuse prevention mechanisms for secure messaging, like abuse reporting and blocklisting.\nIdentifying vulnerabilities with widely-used authenticated encryption schemes (partitioning oracle attacks, MLGR23) and designing new authenticated encryption schemes that better meet needs in practice (LGR22).\n\nI also frequently collaborate with industry. In the past, I have worked with Zoom and Microsoft Research on developing new key transparency systems (ELEKTRA and OPTIKS). I am currently participating as a member of Meta’s Messaging Encryption & Privacy Roundtable group.\n\nImpact:\n\nMy work on Partitioning Oracle Attacks has resulted in updates to the popular anti-censorship tool Shadowsocks, the age file encryption tool, and the IETF draft standards for OPAQUE and HPKE.\nPartitioning Oracle Attacks were also featured as a challenge in the Google Capture the Flag competition in 2021.\n\nCheck out my publications page for more details.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

My research interests are broadly in applied cryptography and computer security, with recent topics focusing on interoperable end-to-end encrypted messaging, abuse prevention for secure messaging, and authenticated encryption. See my research page for more information.\nI co-lead the Cryptography Group with Saba Eskandarian. Check out our website for more information about cryptography research and courses happening at UNC Chapel Hill.\nI’m recruiting Ph.D. students at UNC Chapel Hill for Fall 2026. If you’re interested, list me as a potential faculty member in your application.\n\nTeaching\nCOMP 790-188 Topics in Secure Communication   Spring 2026  COMP 790-188 Topics in Applied Cryptography    Fall 2025\n\n\nHistory\nBefore starting at UNC, I was a METEOR postdoc at MIT working with Henry Corrigan-Gibbs. I completed my Ph.D. in computer science at Cornell University in 2024, where I was advised by Tom Ristenpart. I graduated from UC San Diego in June 2018 with a B.S. in Computer Science, where I was fortunate to work with Mihir Bellare. During my Ph.D., I was also fortunate to intern at Zoom with Antonio Marcedone and at Microsoft Research Redmond with Esha Ghosh and Melissa Chase.\n\n\nService\nI was or am a program committee member for: IEEE S&P 2026, USENIX Security 2025, CATS 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
